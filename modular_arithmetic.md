## Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. This system is fundamental to many areas of mathematics, including elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

### Definition

In modular arithmetic, numbers are considered equivalent if they have the same remainder when divided by the modulus. For a modulus \(n\), the set of possible remainders is \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

For example, with a modulus of \(n = 7\):

$$ \ldots, -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, \ldots $$

are all equivalent to 0 modulo 7.

### Operations

Modular arithmetic supports the usual arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with some restrictions).

1. **Addition**: 
   $$ (a + b) \mod n $$
2. **Subtraction**: 
   $$ (a - b) \mod n $$
3. **Multiplication**: 
   $$ (a \times b) \mod n $$
4. **Division**: Division is possible if the divisor has a multiplicative inverse modulo \(n\). The inverse of \(a\) modulo \(n\) is a number \(b\) such that:
   $$ a \times b \equiv 1 \mod n $$

### Properties

- **Congruence**: Two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are congruent modulo \(n\) if:
  $$ a \equiv b \mod n $$
  This means that \(a\) and \(b\) have the same remainder when divided by \(n\).
- **Closure**: The set of integers modulo \(n\) is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- **Commutativity**: Addition and multiplication are commutative:
  $$ a + b \equiv b + a \mod n $$
  $$ a \times b \equiv b \times a \mod n $$
- **Associativity**: Addition and multiplication are associative:
  $$ (a + b) + c \equiv a + (b + c) \mod n $$
  $$ (a \times b) \times c \equiv a \times (b \times c) \mod n $$

### Applications

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. In elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), modular arithmetic ensures that the results of elliptic curve operations remain within a finite field, providing security and efficiency.

#### Example: Elliptic Curve Cryptography

In ECC, points on an elliptic curve are defined over a finite field. This means that the coordinates of the points are elements of a finite field, typically defined by a prime modulus \(p\). All arithmetic operations on the points are performed modulo \(p\).

For example, the elliptic curve equation:

$$ y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \mod p $$

defines the set of points on the curve in the finite field \(\mathbb{F}_p\).

Modular arithmetic is also used in algorithms for primality testing, integer factorization, and the computation of discrete logarithms, all of which are important in cryptography.

Understanding modular arithmetic is essential for working with elliptic curves and their applications in cryptography and number theory.
